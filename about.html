    Meet Dave and Kelly and the proud owners and operators of The Wave Warehouse. The idea for the Wave Warehouse came about while they were travelling the world surfing- making sure to stop off at every major surfing spot along the way- from Kata beach in Thailand to Surfers Paradise in Australia. At most of their destinations, they seen something that was missing from their beloved hometown beach of Rossnowlagh- a place for surfing locals to chill out and relax with mates.
    <br><br>
    At every beach, they were enthralled by the inclusiveness of surfing legends with beginners, just sitting around having the craic and just hanging out in the shack by the beach.
    <br><br>
    On their return to Rossnowlagh in Summer 2016, they had their hearts set on creating a “Surfers Paradise” for the locals to give them a taste of what’s at sea. After much research and taking a lot of inspiration from our favourite shacks from our travels the idea for Wave Warehouse was formed.
    <br><br>
    Eventually taking the plunge buying the run down local surf club, they put in the necessary love and attention that was needed to transform this run down shack into a desired surfer’s abode.
    <br><br>
    After blood, sweat, tears and help from friends and family The Wave Warehouse was finally ready. We believe it is one of the coolest, welcoming, surf hang out spots in the country.
